> DJs Music API, open source as well as the client. **Requires PHP >=5.4.0**

To run the API server you need to install Composer:

```dos
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

And then install the dependencies:

```dos
php composer.phar install
```

If you want to use this API for your own project check out the [Documentation](https://github.com/DJsMusic/DJsMusic-Client/wiki/API). It is under development so breaking changes could occur any time.

Please feel free to contribute to this project, all code is fairly well documented. The databases behind the API are easily reproduced by looking at the SQL queries.
