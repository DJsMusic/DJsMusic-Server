> DJs Music API, open source as well as the client

If you want to use this API for your own project check out the [Documentation](https://github.com/DJsMusic/DJsMusic-Client/wiki/API). At the momento there is no official way to use this API, it is also under development so breaking changes could occur any time.

Please feel free to contribute to this project, all code is fairly well documented. The databases behind the API are easily reproduced by looking at the SQL queries.
